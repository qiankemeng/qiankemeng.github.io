# Aesthetic Feature Modeling of Classical Jiangnan Gardens

**Honor**: National First Prize, China Graduate Mathematical Modeling Contest

## Background

Classical Jiangnan gardens are treasures of traditional Chinese culture, embodying rich aesthetic philosophy and design wisdom. This research applies mathematical modeling methods to quantitatively analyze the aesthetic features of Jiangnan gardens, revealing the intrinsic relationships between spatial layout and aesthetic experience.

## Methodology

### 1. Feature Extraction and Quantification

We established a multi-dimensional indicator system for garden aesthetic features:
- **Spatial Hierarchy**: Analyzing connectivity and hierarchical structure using graph theory
- **Visual Rhythm**: Quantifying landscape element distribution through fractal dimensions
- **Artistic Conception**: Evaluating cultural connotations using semantic analysis

### 2. Mathematical Model Construction

Multiple mathematical tools were employed:
- Graph theory and network analysis
- Fractal geometry
- Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation
- Multi-objective optimization

### 3. Data Collection and Validation

Field surveys were conducted at representative gardens in Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other cities to collect spatial data and subjective evaluations, validating model effectiveness.

## Key Findings

1. **Golden Ratio Application**: The proportional relationships between architecture and water surfaces generally follow the golden ratio
2. **Fractal Self-Similarity**: Rockeries and plant arrangements exhibit significant fractal characteristics
3. **Mathematical Patterns in Spatial Sequences**: Tour path designs follow specific mathematical curves

## Practical Value

- Providing scientific basis for classical garden preservation and restoration
- Guiding integration of traditional elements in modern garden design
- Advancing quantitative research methodologies in Eastern aesthetics

## Team Contribution

This project was completed by a three-person team. I was primarily responsible for model construction and algorithm design.
